# Lockscreen-Trap

Bait your colleagues.

Small python3 script that snaps a webcam photo and locks the computer when a keyboard/mouse press is detected.
A countermeasure solution to those that are eager to pull a prank on an unlocked machine.

OS: Linux   Tested: Arch Linux (testing appreciated but should work)

Dependencies:
python3   (Most distros usually have it)  
pynput    (pip3 install pynput)           
bash      (Most distros should have it)   
mplayer   (For taking screenshots)        


STILL WIP
